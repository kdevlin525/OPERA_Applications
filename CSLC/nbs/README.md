## Guide for running bulk processing with COMPASS

Below outlines how to generate OPERA CSLC products using COregistered Multi-temPorAl Sar Slc toolbox.

üö® The COMPASS toolbox is still in **pre-alpha** stage and undergoing **rapid development**. üö®

### Install

The following will install COMPASS into a conda environment. Using `mamba` to install the dependencies is a faster option compared to using `conda`.

1. Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opera-adt/COMPASS.git
```
2. Create COMPASS conda environment:

First create and activate COMPASS conda environment.

```bash
mamba create -n COMPASS
conda activate COMPASS
```

Create a `conda_compass.sh` file. This file can be in a directory of conda setup scripts if you already have one. The file should be in this format:

```bash 
#!/bin/bash

module purge

conda deactivate
unset conda

source <path_to_conda_installation>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
export PATH="<path_to_conda_installation>/bin:$PATH"

conda activate COMPASS

export CPL_ZIP_ENCODING="UTF-8"
```
Run `bash conda_compass.sh` to activate COMPASS environment

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge --file COMPASS/requirements.txt
mamba install -c conda-forge isce3
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/opera-adt/s1-reader.git
```

4. Install `COMPASS` via pip:

```bash
python -m pip install ./COMPASS
```

### Usage

The following commands generate coregistered SLC in radar or geo-coordinates from terminal:

```bash
s1_cslc.py --grid geo   <path to s1_cslc_geo   yaml file>
s1_cslc.py --grid radar <path to s1_cslc_radar yaml file for reference burst>
s1_cslc.py --grid radar <path to s1_cslc_radar yaml file for secondary burst>
```

The command below will generate a stack of coregistered SLCs.

```bash
s1_geocode_stack.py -s <path_to_SLCs> -d <path_to_DEM> --burst-db-file <path_to_db_file>  --burst-id <S!_bust_ID> -w <path_to_working_dir> --metadata
```
will generate run_files sub dir in stack dir
